    <h1>Fresh Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../images/pasta.webp">
    <p>Fresh pasta is a type of pasta made from simple 
        ingredients like flour and eggs, resulting in 
        a tender and delicate texture. Unlike dried pasta, 
        it has a shorter cooking time and a rich, authentic 
        flavor that is often preferred in Italian cuisine.</p>

    <p><h2>Required Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps to Making the Best Homemade Pasta</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, make a nest with the flour on a clean 
            work surface. Add the remaining ingredients to 
            the center and use a fork to gently break up the 
            eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best 
            as you can!</li>
        <li>Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour.
             Continue working the dough to bring it together 
             into a shaggy ball.</li>
        <li>Then, knead! At the beginning, the dough should 
            feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not 
            feel like it’s going to come together, but after 
            8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive 
            and smooth:</li>
        <li>When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball 
            and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at 
            room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the dough rests, slice it into 4 pieces.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten 
            one into an oval disk.</li>
        <li>Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta 
            maker (level 1 on the KitchenAid attachment). I run the 
            dough through the pasta maker 3 times on this setting 
            before proceeding to the next step. If you don’t have 
            the KitchenAid attachment, roll out the dough according 
            to your pasta maker’s instructions.</li>
        <li>Next, fold the dough… if you want to. This step is somewhat 
            optional, but it will make your final pasta sheet more rectangular, 
            which will yield more long strands of pasta. Plus, it’s super 
            simple! Just lay the dough flat and fold both short ends 
            in to meet in the center.</li>
        <li>Then fold it in half lengthwise to form a rectangle.</li>
        <li>Once you’ve folded the dough, roll it out to your desired thickness.
             On my KitchenAid attachment, I run it through the pasta roller 
             three times on level 2, three times on level 3, and one time 
             each on levels 4, 5, and 6.</li>
        <li>Repeat these steps with the remaining dough pieces. Each time 
            you finish with a piece of dough, lay one half of it on a 
            lightly floured baking sheet. Sprinkle the dough with flour, 
            and fold the other half on top. Sprinkle the top with flour, 
            too!</li>
        <li>Finally, cut and cook the pasta. Run the pasta sheets through 
            your desired pasta cutter attachment. Cook the noodles in a pot 
            of boiling salted water for 1 minute, and enjoy!</li>
